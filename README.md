1) Flex Box Times Challenge
    Here I learnt how to use flexbox effectively.
    
2) Clockworks
    The focus here is in understanding and learning basic javascript.

3) Travel Forest
    This is an intermediate project wherein I learnt about Sass and how to make a main css file have multiple scss files.
    I also learnt about the usage of clippy, font awesome and how to minify your own version of css for a specific project.
    This project shows how powerful Sass is in designing front-end web pages and helps make the code very tidy.
